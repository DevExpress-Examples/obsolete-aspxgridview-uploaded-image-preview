⛔ DEPRECATED. This example shows how to use ASPxUploadControl on the ASPxGridView's Edit Form to preview an image before performing data update. Starting with v15.1, this functionality is available out of the box. Set the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.BinaryImageEditingSettings.Enabled">GridViewDataBinaryImageColumn.PropertiesBinaryImage.EditingSettings.Enabled</a> property to `True` to activate it. 

You can try this functionality in the following online demo:
